**1) Create a set of standard pizza objects with these attributes:
  a) Type (pepperoni, hawaiian, cheese, etc)
  b) Base price per size?? - an array of 3 prices per pizza type?
  c) Total cost including modifications
  d) List of added extras
2) Create an order object that contains: --> once 1) is complete and tested!
  a) The list of pizzas objects for this order
  b) Potential order modifications (extra toppings) and their prices?
  c) Total price of order
**3) Prototype method selects the cost of the size of pizza and
  b) second prototype method adds the cost of toppings to create total cost
**4) Prototype method adds cost of selected pizzas for total order price??
**5) Q: Create set of standard pizza objects at beginning of jQuery or initiate them as customer selects them from a drop down menu????
6) Further exploration priorities:
  a) User can order more than one pizza (see 2 above)
  b) Add ability to change order after pizza object constructed (new methods)
  **c) Checkboxes for add-ons
  c) Delivery option with additional cost
  d) List of pizzas as links with details
**7) Treat all money values as number of cents and divide by 100 before user display
**8) Create a method to return a friendly description of the pizza
9) Change the size price customer (dropdown) display depending on what type of pizza they select
**10) Hide/show next selection box? do this without a submit button?
FIXED&&& BUG: When a user selects a size and submits, then selects another size the two prices add
